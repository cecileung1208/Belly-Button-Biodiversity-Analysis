## Background

The objective of this project is to create an webpage with an interactive dashboard using various visualizations to analyze Belly Button Biodiversity for different samples. Datasets are provided in JSON format where D3 was used to import and read the data while using Plotly to create the required visualizations.

## Requirements

Create an interactive dashboard with a dropdown menu for each subject ID by providing the following:
1.  Demographics Information that includes ID, ethnicity, gender, age, location, BB Type and Washing Frequency
2.  Horizontal Bar Chart on Top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) Found
3.  Gauge Chart for Weekly Washing Frequency 
4.  Bubble Chart for the Concentration of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) for each Belly Button Sample
